Recreating Facemash! 


## How to Use
You must use download your targeted images and number them. E.g if I have 500 girls of images in .jpeg format; I must name them 1.jpeg all the way to 500.jpeg (Any image format of course). You can create simple script to automatically name them or when mass downloading images set them to.
