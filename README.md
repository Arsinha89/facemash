Recreating Facemash! 


## How to Use
You must use download your targeted images and number them. E.g if I have 500 images of girls in .jpeg format; I must name them 1.jpeg all the way to 500.jpeg (Any image format of course). You can create simple script to automatically name them or when mass downloading images set them to.

## Demo

Main page! Each girl/image has their current rank rating and will be updated depending on whether they have lost or not; Using elo rating algorithm. The opponents are completely random however, I filter any case where two opponent is same girl. In that case, we randomise again.
